As part of the capstone experience for education majors, they must submit a collection of 15 items (5 Planning, 5 Instruction, and 5 Assessment), each with very specific criteria (edTPA Education Teacher Performance Assessment). Missing items or submitted items that do not conform to the criteria prevent a successful submission. The software for this project would develop a submission checker. All aspects of the submission that can be automatically checked, would be checked and approved by the software. All aspects of the submission that cannot be easily checked, would be interactively queried of the user by the software. This would be a Turbo-Tax-style application that would walk the user through the submission process. There is a second (extended) component to the project that would involve a more complex algorithm to do analysis on parts of the application and help the students improve their submission. The first part would be the primary focus of the effort; the second component would integrated into the checker ‚Äìit would be a greater challenge, but not the primary focus of the project.

Currently, Task One is the main component that we've been working on. When you click the "Help" button, a Help window is appears with instructions on how to use the application. From the Main Menu page, click on the golden "Task One" button to navigate to the first task page. From here, you can upload a file and the application will provide feedback based on the font size, font family, page margins, and number of pages.
